# Math is awesome: Fourier
_Explaining and demonstrating Fourier transformations of line drawings_

__Reference:__ 
This work is inspired by [a great visualization of Fourier Series](https://mobile.twitter.com/jagarikin/status/962449509782495232) by [@jagarikin](https://mobile.twitter.com/jagarikin).

## Content
1. [Background](Fourier-Series-of-Curves-Background.ipynb) - Explains the mathematical background of creating such animations
and introduces Fourier series as a perfect tool for this. There are some more notebooks that
explicitly compute the Fourier coefficients for concrete classes of curves:
    1. [Straight Lines and Polygons](Fourier-Series-of-Curves-Example-1-Polygones.ipynb)
    2. [Ellipse Arcs](Fourier-Series-of-Curves-Example-2-Arcs.ipynb)
    3. [BÃ©zier Curves](Fourier-Series-of-Curves-Example-3-Bezier.ipynb)
